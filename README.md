The MegaMan Battle Network Fan Gacha Simulator is a free and open source gacha game based
on the MegaMan Battle Network series by Capcom. No profit is being made from this project,
and all graphical assets were made specifically for this fan game.

Gather some Zenny and do some pulls to get characters! This is purely the gacha part
of a gacha game, so unfortuntely you can't do anything with the characters.
Still, it's all the fun of "watch-number-go-up" without breaking the bank!

How to play:
- index.html is the starting page for this game.
- Go to the Zenny Generator page and click on the button to get Zenny.
- Spend the currency on pulls!
- The History page can be used to see your past pulls, up to the last 50 pulls.
- The Gallery page allows you to view characters without needing to get them
in a pull. You can also view how many of each character you got in the Gallery,
the count will be listed with each characters' descriptions!
- Same idea with the Costume Gallery, except it's specifically for the special costumes.
- Use the True Gacha Mode button to change the rates for the pulls, with the
True Gacha Mode rates being more brutal and closer to rates in real gacha games.
