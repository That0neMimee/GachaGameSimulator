The Gacha Game Simulator is a free and open source gacha game. Gather some
currency and do some pulls to get characters! This is purely the gacha part
of a gacha game, so unfortuntely you can't do anything with the characters.
Still, it's all the fun of "watch-number-go-up" without breaking the bank!

How to play:
- index.html is the starting page for this game.
- Go to the Currency Generator page and click on the button to get Currency.
- Spend the currency on pulls!
- The History page can be used to see your past pulls, up to the last 50 pulls.
- The Gallery page allows you to view characters without needing to get them
in a pull. You can also view how many of each character you got in the Gallery,
the count will be listed with each characters' descriptions!

The main points I want to emphasize for any derivatives of this code is the
following:
 - This code is open source and can be modified as you wish.
 - You must give credit to me (Wren the Dragon Marquise, or just
DragonMarquise) as the creator of the base code.
 - Also include a link to the GitHub repository of the original code
(https://github.com/DragonMarquise/GachaGameSimulator) with the creator credit.
 - Any derivatives made from my code should also be released under the
same license, and hence they should also be open source.

Besides that, know that this code uses a combination of HTML,
Javascript, and a bit of CSS, along with plenty of images. Feel free to make
your own gacha simulators based off of this code as you please!

Note that there is also a version of this game hosted on Itch.io,
for people to play right in their browser: https://dragonmarquise.itch.io/gacha-game-simulator

Current ideas for future updates:
 - "Difficulty modes" of sorts, basically just changing the rates to be closer to the
(more ridiculous) rates seen in most gacha games. The current set of rates in the simulator
would be set for a "Casual Mode", while more accurate/harder rates could be called an "Authentic Mode".
 - Add additional tiers? Most gacha games tend to have 4 to 5 tiers. Current ideas are two tiers
above Gold (Platinum as second-rarest, and Diamond as the new rarest), or a new tier above Gold (Platinum)
and a new tier below Bronze (Maybe Pyrite/Fool's Gold? Or Iron, or maybe even Wood for the hilarity of it).
Will need to come up with new characters for those tiers as well, at least for this base repository.
