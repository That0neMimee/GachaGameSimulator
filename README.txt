The Gacha Game Simulator code is licensed under a GNU Affero General
Public License version 3 (GNU AGPLv3).

The main points I want to emphasize for any derivatives of this code is the
following:
     This code is open source and can be modified as you wish.
     You must give credit to me (Wren the Dragon Marquise, or just
DragonMarquise) as the creator of the base code. Also include a link to
the GitHub repository of the original code (///) with the creator credit.
     Any derivatives made from my code should also be released under the
same license, and hence they should also be open source.

The full license terms of the GNU AGPLv3 is available in the LICENSE.txt
file included with this code.

Besides that, know that this code uses a combination of HTML,
Javascript, and a bit of CSS, along with plenty of images. Feel free to make
your own gacha simulators based off of this code as you please!

Also, while this isn't a license requirement, I would appreciate it if you let
me know if you make your own simulators based off this code! I would
love to see what people do with this. I can be contacted on Reddit
(www.reddit.com/user/DragonMarquise) and Twitter
(twitter.com/DragonMarquise). (move this to GitHub description instead)
